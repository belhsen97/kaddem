# Objective 
In order to prepare for the new demands of the job market, we propose to work on the "KADDEM" project.

# Description 
- We want to create an application to manage student contracts as part of the "Kaddem" project.
This project defines a program for allocating students to teams in each department of the participating universities.
- Each team will have one of the levels (junior/senior or expert) in one of the following specialties: AI, networks, security, cloud.
- The project therefore offers students contracts according to specialty and level.
- Each student obtains a contract if he/she joins a team. If he/she is assigned to several teams, he/she will have a contract for each activity with a team.
- The contract is simply a moral commitment between the student and his university ðŸ¡º so he must honor his commitment by taking an active part in his team's development.
